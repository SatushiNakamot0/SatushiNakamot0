## About

I'm currently working on neural network compression techniques for embedded systems as part of my research, while developing GazerStar, an AI agent orchestration platform. My academic background in CPGE gave me strong foundations in mathematics and algorithmic problem-solving, which I apply to practical AI engineering challenges.

**Research Interests:** Model compression, edge AI, neural network pruning, hardware-aware optimization

**Engineering Focus:** AI agent systems, scalable architectures, full-stack development

## Technical Skills

**Languages:** Python, C++, JavaScript, PHP, SQL, Bash

**AI/ML:** TensorFlow, PyTorch, OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas

**Frameworks:** Django, Laravel, React, Node.js

**Tools:** Docker, Git, Linux

## Selected Projects

### GazerStar
AI agent orchestration platform with visual representation and workflow composition. Built with Django/Laravel backend and React frontend, using LangGraph for agent coordination. Currently in active development.

### EthnicGuesser
Web application for name-based ethnic origin prediction using probabilistic classification methods. Deployed at [ethnicguesser.com](https://ethnicguesser.com).

### Neural Network Compression Research
TIPE research project investigating pruning techniques (structured and unstructured) for reducing computational cost of neural networks on embedded systems like ESP32. Analyzing performance-accuracy trade-offs and hardware constraints.

### SmartSport System
Software engineering project with complete UML design (use case, sequence, class diagrams) and multi-role architecture implementation.
